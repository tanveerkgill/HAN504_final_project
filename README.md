# HHA504_final_project
Instructions for assignment:

This project uses Azure services to construct a small, practical healthcare cloud system (with analogies to GCP and OCI, which were also discussed in the course). The objective is to provide a working end-to-end pipeline that incorporates computation, storage, a controlled database, and an analytics component while adhering to the architectural patterns that have been practiced all semester.

**1. Understand the Use Case**  
Begin by reviewing the use_case.md file. This document defines the remote blood pressure monitoring scenario, identifies the users, describes the problem being solved, and outlines the data sources and workflow. Make sure you understand how patient-submitted daily blood pressure readings flow into the system, how they are validated and flagged for risk, and how summary metrics are generated for clinic staff.

**2. Review the Architecture Diagram**  
Open the generated PNG diagram.

Included in the image is:

Frontend / Access layer  
Serverless and container-based compute layer  
Object storage and relational database  
Optional analytics / reporting component  

**3. Read the Architecture & Implementation Plan**  
Which cloud services are used and why  
How credentials, RBAC, and governance are handled  
Cost considerations and where serverless is used to minimize spending  
The detailed step-by-step data flow from ingestion all the way to summary reporting  

This plan ties the architecture back to the concepts taught in Azure, GCP, and OCI labs.
