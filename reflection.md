I feel most confident in the overall structure of the data pipeline, particularly the flow from unstructured JSON files in Azure Blob Storage into well defined tables in Azure SQL. Using a medallion style approach that moves data from raw ingestion to cleaned and structured formats aligns with common industry practices and supports clear data lineage. This design also makes auditing easier if a specific reading ever needs to be reviewed. I am especially comfortable with the use of Azure Functions as the connecting layer between storage and the database, since the event driven model keeps the system efficient while helping control costs.

That said, I am less confident about how the current data validation logic would scale over time. As the number of patients increases, relying on fixed rules to flag readings as high or critical may become limiting. In real clinical environments, thresholds often vary based on a patient’s baseline health and medical history. A more adaptive approach such as a configurable rules engine or a machine learning model that dynamically adjusts thresholds would improve accuracy, but it would also require additional research and development to implement properly.

I also explored an alternative design using a NoSQL solution like Azure Cosmos DB, which would naturally support the variability of JSON data coming from different home monitoring devices. Ultimately, I chose Azure SQL because healthcare reporting tasks such as calculating weekly blood pressure averages or generating trend data for clinician dashboards are more intuitive and performant in a relational database. For a primary care focused use case where reporting and analytics are central, the structure and query capabilities of SQL outweigh the flexibility offered by NoSQL.

If I were given an additional eight weeks and unlimited cloud credits, my primary focus would be improving interoperability. I would implement Azure Health Data Services and transform incoming data into HL7 FHIR format so the system could integrate directly with Electronic Health Record platforms such as Epic or Cerner. I would also add authentication through Azure Active Directory, now Microsoft Entra ID, to enable single sign on for clinic staff. This would allow users to log in with their existing institutional credentials, improving both usability and overall security.
